# userscripts

## How to use

I use my userscripts with Violentmonkey on Firefox

- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/

It must normally work on Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey, but feel free to fill an issue if you have an issue.

## Compare Amazon prices

The goal is to have a way to easily check the price of multiple domain for an article.

- You can fill the DOMAIN_LIST in the script, if you do, don't hesitate to make a pull request, so it can be updated for everyone
- I noticed that multiple product on the page doesn't work, my first though it that I need to trigger the comparison with an event when the page reload, but it's still not done yet
